### Important notes about the job and web session

- When you submit a job using this interface, a web session is created for you to interact with the job. 

- Closing your browser window or tab will NOT stop the running job or web session. Likewise, if you experience network issues, you may be disconnected from your web session and be returned to a login page, however the job and web session *will still be running*. You can reconnect freely using the Connect button below.  

- *Closing the application* within the web session *will* also stop the web session and then the job will be canceled; your browser will display a "Failed to connect" message.

- If you wish to stop the job and web session, please use the "Cancel" button above.
